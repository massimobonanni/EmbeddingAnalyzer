# Embedding Analyzer

Embedding Analyzer is a console application that allows you to calculate the cosine similarity distance between two texts using embedding models in Azure OpenAI.

## What is Cosine Similarity?

Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space. It is defined as the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. In the context of text analysis, cosine similarity is often used to determine how similar two texts are based on their word embeddings.

To learn more about cosine similarity, you can visit the [Cosine similarity page on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity).

## Azure OpenAI

Azure OpenAI provides powerful natural language processing capabilities, including pre-trained embedding models that can be used to calculate cosine similarity. To get started with Azure OpenAI, you can refer to the [Azure OpenAI documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai-index).
